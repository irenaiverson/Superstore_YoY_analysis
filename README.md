# Superstore YoY Analysis - Tableau project

This project involved designing an interactive Year-over-Year (YoY) Performance Dashboard using Tableau Desktop Public, leveraging the widely-used sample dataset Superstore.xls. The goal was to allow users to explore annual performance changes across four key metrics â€” Sales, Profit, Orders, and Customers â€” and break them down by Category, Segment, Shipping Mode, and State.

## Tableau Dashboard

Explore the interactive visualization here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/irena.iverson/viz/SuperstorePerformanceAnalysisYoY/Dashboard 

The dashboard is fully dynamic, with:

- Year selector for toggling between different years

- KPI buttons that switch metrics across all visualizations

- YoY bar and map comparisons

- Conditional formatting for performance trends (e.g., red bars for declines)

- A hoverable info icon with dashboard instructions

## Dataset & Data Fields

## Recommendations
- Investigate Profitability in Underperforming Areas

    Despite growth in sales and orders, profit lags behind in categories like Furniture and the Corporate segment, with losses in states such as Indiana and Michigan.

    ðŸ‘‰ Recommendation: Review discounting strategies, shipping costs, or product margins in those segments and regions.

- Leverage High-Growth Regions for Expansion

    States like Washington, Delaware, and Minnesota saw dramatic YoY profit gains.

    ðŸ‘‰ Recommendation: Analyze whatâ€™s driving success in those markets and replicate strategies in other regions.

- Reallocate Marketing Budget Toward Home Office Segment

    Home Office customers consistently drive top performance across sales, orders, and profit.

    ðŸ‘‰ Recommendation: Focus targeted promotions and loyalty efforts on this segment.

- Evaluate Shipping Mode Efficiency

    First Class shipping saw strong growth in both profit and order volume, while Same Day shipping had a sharp decline in profit.

    ðŸ‘‰ Recommendation: Review logistics and pricing strategies for Same Day fulfillment to improve profitability.

- Monitor YoY Trends Monthly

    Strong fluctuations across months highlight the importance of tracking KPIs monthly, not just annually.

    ðŸ‘‰ Recommendation: Set up periodic monthly reports.
